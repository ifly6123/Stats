        <h2>What Does RÂ² Tell Us? ðŸ¤”</h2>
        <p>Imagine you made a scatter plot showing how many hours students studied ($x$) and their test scores ($y$). You then drew the "line of best fit" (the regression line) that tries to predict the score based on study hours.</p>

        <p><strong>R-squared</strong> (written as $R^2$) is like a <strong>"grade" for your prediction line</strong>. It tells you <strong>what percentage (%) of the <em>difference</em> in test scores can be explained by the <em>difference</em> in study hours.</strong></p>

        <p>Think about it: Why do students get different scores?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One reason might be that they studied for different amounts of time. $R^2$ tells us how much of the score difference is because of <strong>study time</strong>. (This is the <strong>explained</strong> part).</li>
            <li>But there are other reasons too! Maybe some students slept well, some are naturally better at the subject, some were lucky, some were unlucky. These <strong>other</strong> reasons cause differences in scores that our study time line <em>can't</em> explain. (This is the <strong>unexplained</strong> part or "error").</li>
        </ul>
        <p>$R^2$ measures how much of the story (the difference in scores) is told by the factor we looked at (study time).</p>

        <h2>Reading the RÂ² Grade ðŸŽ¯</h2>
        <p>$R^2$ is always a number between <strong>0 and 1</strong>, which we usually talk about as a <strong>percentage (0% to 100%)</strong>.</p>

        <div class="correlation-visuals">
            <div>
                <strong>$R^2 = 0.90$ (90%)</strong>
                <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Wow! 90% of the reason scores are different is because study hours were different. Our line is a great predictor!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>$R^2 = 0.50$ (50%)</strong>
                <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Okay. 50% of the score differences are explained by study hours. The other 50% is due to other stuff. The line is an okay predictor.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>$R^2 = 0.10$ (10%)</strong>
                <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Hmm. Only 10% of the score difference is related to study hours. Most of the difference is because of other things. This line isn't a very good predictor.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>An $R^2$ of <strong>1.0 (100%)</strong> means your line is a perfect predictor. All the dots are exactly on the line. Knowing $x$ lets you know $y$ perfectly.</li>
            <li>An $R^2$ of <strong>0 (0%)</strong> means your line is useless. Knowing the study hours tells you <strong>nothing</strong> about the likely test score.</li>
            <li>A <strong>higher $R^2$ means your line "fits" the dots better</strong>. What counts as "good" depends on what you're studying. Sometimes even a low $R^2$ can be interesting!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Link Between $r$ and $R^2$ (It's Easy!)</h2>
        <p>Remember the correlation coefficient ($r$)? It tells you how strong the <em>linear</em> relationship is (from -1 to +1).</p>
        <p>For simple predictions (just one $x$ predicting one $y$), $R^2$ is simply <strong>$r$ multiplied by itself!</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600;">$R^2 = r \times r = r^2$</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the correlation $r$ is strong (like +0.8 or -0.8), squaring it gives a high $R^2$ (like 0.64 or 64%). A strong relationship means the line fits well!</li>
            <li>If the correlation $r$ is weak (like +0.2 or -0.2), squaring it gives a very low $R^2$ (like 0.04 or 4%). A weak relationship means the line fits poorly.</li>
            <li>Since squaring a negative number makes it positive, $R^2$ is always between 0 and 1.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Simple Analogy: Explaining Plant Growth ðŸŒ±</h2>
        <p>Imagine you're trying to explain why some tomato plants ($y$) grew taller than others.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You measure how much water ($x$) each plant got and find a decent relationship. You make a prediction line and calculate $R^2 = 0.70$.</li>
            <li>This means <strong>70%</strong> of the difference in plant heights can be explained by the difference in how much water they received.</li>
            <li>The other <strong>30%</strong> (100% - 70%) is due to other things you didn't measure (sunlight, soil quality, type of tomato, etc.). This is the <strong>unexplained</strong> part.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>$R^2$ tells you how good your chosen factor (water) is at explaining the outcome (height).</p>
        <p>You can see $R^2$ calculated live in the <a href="../module2.html">Module 2: Relationship Explorer</a>!</p>
