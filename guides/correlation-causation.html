        <h2>The BIGGEST Rule in Statistics!</h2>
        <p>This is probably the most important idea to remember when looking at data: <strong>Correlation does NOT imply causation!</strong></p>
        <p>What does this mean?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Correlation</strong> just means two things seem to happen together or move in a related way (like we saw with the correlation coefficient, $r$).</li>
            <li><strong>Causation</strong> means that one thing *directly causes* another thing to happen (like flipping a light switch *causes* the light to turn on).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's super tempting to think that if two things are strongly correlated, one must be causing the other. But often, that's wrong!</p>

        <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

        <h2>The Classic Example: Ice Cream Sales and Crime Rates üç¶üöì</h2>
        <p>Imagine you collect data over a year and make a scatter plot. You find a strong positive correlation (maybe $r = +0.7$) between the amount of ice cream sold each month and the number of crimes reported each month.</p>

        <p><strong>Does this mean eating ice cream CAUSES crime?</strong> Of course not! That sounds silly.</p>
        <p><strong>Does committing crimes CAUSE people to want ice cream?</strong> Probably not!</p>
        <p>So, what's going on? There's usually a **hidden reason** (a third variable) that's affecting *both* things. This hidden reason is called a <strong>confounding variable</strong> or a lurking variable.</p>

        <h3>What's the Hidden Reason Here?</h3>
        <p>In this case, the confounding variable is **Hot Weather (Temperature)**.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>When it's hot, <strong>more people buy ice cream</strong>.</li>
            <li>When it's hot, <strong>more people are outside</strong>, maybe leaving windows open, and sometimes tempers flare more easily, which can lead to an <strong>increase in crime</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The hot weather causes both ice cream sales AND crime rates to go up together. They are correlated, but one doesn't cause the other. The heat is the real driver.</p>

        <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

        <h2>Why is This So Important?</h2>
        <p>Mistaking correlation for causation leads to bad decisions and silly conclusions!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You might see a correlation between kids who play video games and kids who get good grades. Does playing games *cause* good grades? Probably not. Maybe kids who have more free time (because they finish homework quickly) do both?</li>
            <li>You might see a correlation between the number of storks in a town and the number of babies born. Do storks deliver babies? No! Towns with more people tend to have both more houses (good for stork nests) and more babies. The **town size** is the confounding variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Always ask:</strong> Is there another reason these two things might be happening together? What's the hidden story?</p>

        <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

        <h2>Test Your Understanding! ü§î</h2>
        <p>Read the scenario below and try to guess the hidden (confounding) variable.</p>

        <div class="interactive-calc dark-bg">
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A study finds a positive correlation between the number of firefighters who respond to a fire and the amount of damage caused by the fire. The more firefighters, the more damage!</p>
            <p><strong>Does this mean firefighters are *causing* more damage?</strong> What's a likely confounding variable?</p>
